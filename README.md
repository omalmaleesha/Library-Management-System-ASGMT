Below is a well-structured README.md file for your "Online Library Management System" project (or "student-registration" as mentioned in your latest output—I'll assume it’s the same project with a different name). This README covers the project overview, setup instructions, usage, and other details required for your assignment deliverables. You can customize it further based on your specific needs.

Online Library Management System
Project Overview
This is a web-based application developed as part of the SE1020 - Object-Oriented Programming course assignment. The system implements a User Management module for an Online Library Management System, allowing users to register, search, update, and delete user records. It demonstrates the application of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, along with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using file handling techniques.

Key Features
User Registration: Add new users to the system.
User Search: Retrieve user details by username.
User Update: Modify existing user information.
User Deletion: Remove users from the system.
File-Based Storage: Uses a CSV file (users.csv) for persistent data storage instead of a database.
Web Interface: Built with JSP, Servlets, and HTML/CSS (enhanced with Bootstrap).
Assignment Details
Grade Weightage: 10%
Development Environment: IntelliJ IDEA, Java, JSP, Servlets, HTML/CSS, Bootstrap (via CDN)
Data Storage: File read/write operations (CSV file)
Version Control: Git (with commit history available in the repository)

src/main/java: Contains Java source code (model, DAO, and servlets).
src/main/webapp: Holds web resources (JSPs, HTML, and CSV file).
pom.xml: Maven configuration file for dependencies and build settings.
Prerequisites
Java: Version 8 or higher
IntelliJ IDEA: Latest version recommended
Maven: Bundled with IntelliJ (no local installation required)
Git: For version control (optional for local setup, required for submission)
Setup Instructions
1. Clone the Repository
If hosted on GitHub:

bash

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
git clone https://github.com/your-username/student-registration.git
cd student-registration
For local setup, skip this step and proceed to project creation.

2. Open in IntelliJ IDEA
Launch IntelliJ IDEA.
Select File > Open and choose the student-registration folder.
IntelliJ will recognize it as a Maven project and load the pom.xml.
3. Configure the Project
Verify Maven: Ensure IntelliJ uses its bundled Maven:
Go to File > Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Build Tools > Maven.
Confirm "Maven home directory" is set to "Bundled (Maven 3)".
Reimport Maven Project:
Open the Maven tool window (View > Tool Windows > Maven).
Click the "Reimport All Maven Projects" button (circular arrow icon).
4. Prepare Sample Data
Ensure src/main/webapp/data/users.csv exists with initial data:
text

Copy
1,john,john123,john@example.com
2,jane,jane456,jane@example.com
If missing, create the data directory and file manually.
Running the Application
Using IntelliJ IDEA
Start the Tomcat Server:
Open the Maven tool window.
Expand student-registration > Plugins > tomcat7.
Double-click tomcat7:run.
Monitor the Console:
Look for "Server startup in [X] ms" to confirm the server is running.
Access the Application:
Open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080/.
The index.html page will display with options to "Register New User" or "Search Users."
Troubleshooting
Port Conflict: If 8080 is in use, edit <port> in pom.xml to 8081 and re-run.
File Not Found: Ensure users.csv is in src/main/webapp/data/.
Usage
Register a User:
Click "Register New User" on the homepage.
Fill in the form (username, password, email) and submit.
Search a User:
Click "Search Users" on the homepage.
Enter a username and submit to view details, with options to edit or delete.
Update a User:
From the search results, click "Edit," modify the details, and submit.
Delete a User:
From the search results, click "Delete" to remove the user.
Data is stored in users.csv and updated with each operation.

Deliverables
Source Code:
All .java, .jsp, and .html files in src/.
pom.xml for project configuration.
Documentation:
Class Diagrams: Available in the report (create using IntelliJ or tools like UMLet).
Final Report: Includes Git commit history (generate via git log or GitHub).
Viva Presentation:
Sample data in users.csv.
Demonstrate CRUD operations and backend logic (focus on UserDAO.java and Servlets).
Show Git commit history in the repository.
OOP Concepts Implemented
Encapsulation: User class encapsulates user data with private fields and public getters/setters.
Inheritance: Servlets extend HttpServlet for web functionality.
Polymorphism: Overridden methods in Servlets (doGet, doPost) handle different HTTP requests.
Notes
File Storage: Data persists in users.csv within the webapp directory. In a production environment, consider a more robust storage solution.
Thread Safety: UserDAO methods are synchronized to handle concurrent access safely.
UI: Bootstrap is used via CDN for responsive design.
